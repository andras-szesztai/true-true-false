## How to Play

In TrueTrueFalse, your aim will be to find out which one is the false statement out of three given by one of your fellow players. You win points if you guess the false statement correctly, but you lose points if you select one of the two true statements. You can also gain points with your own statements, but first letâ€™s find out how the game is played.

When the room creator starts the game, you will be prompted to provide 3 statements of yourself, the first two of them will have to be true, while the last one is false. After each player submits their answers, the administrator starts the first round, for which a player will be picked randomly to present their own shuffled statements in a few words, while keeping their truthy or falsy nature secret. The rest of the participants will have 10 questions per round to find out more about the statements presented. Whenever they feel that they found out enough to make a guess, or they ran out of questions, a guess will be submitted.

In the next phase, the room admin will reveal the guesses of each player and the false statement itself, which opens the scoring round. Each correctly guessing player gets 1 point, plus one point for each fellow player who selected incorrectly, while each incorrectly guessing player gets to lose 1 point, plus one point for each correctly guessing player.

In addition,the player who gave the statements can receive point based on how many of the statements were selected by the other players, 3 points for each set of 3 players selecting 3 different statements and 2 points for each set of 2 player selecting 2 of the statements. As an example, the player giving the statements receives 5 points if the guessing result was the following: First Statement - 2 guesses, Second Statement - 3 guesses, Third Statement - 1 guess. This scoring rule is in place to reward players for statements that are either obviously true or false.

The round gets repeated until all players who provided statements can present their statements and the others can guess them. At the end of the game, the final scoring is displayed and the admin shall delete the room & statements.

Have fun while getting to know your fellow players better!
