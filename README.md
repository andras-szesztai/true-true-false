## How to Play

In TrueTrueFalse your aim will be to find out which is the false statement
out of three, given by one of your fellow players. If you guess the false
statement, you win points, but if you select one of the two true ones, you lose points.
In addition, you can also gain points with your own statements, but first letâ€™s find out
how the game is played.

When the room creator (admin) starts the game, you will be prompted to provide 3 statements of yourself, the first two of them have to be true, while the last one is false. After each player submits their answers, the administrator starts the first round, for which a player will be picked randomly to present in a few words their own shuffled statements, all this while keeping their truthy or falsy nature secret. Then, the rest of the participants have 10 questions per round to find out more about the 3 statements presented. Whenever they feel that they found out enough to make a guess, or they ran out of questions, a guess will be submitted.

In the next phase of the round, the room admin will reveals the guesses of each
player, then the false statement. After this part comes the scoring round. Each correctly guessing player gets 1 point, plus one point for each fellow player who selected a true statement, meaning they guessed incorrectly. Each falsely guessing player gets to lose 1 point, plus one point for each correctly guessing player.

In addition,the player who gave the statement can receive point based on how many of the statements were selected by the other players, 3 points for each set of 3 players selecting 3 different statements and 2 points for each set of 2 player (remaining) selecting 2 of the statements. As an example, the player giving the statements receives 5 points if the guessing result was the following: First Statement - 2 guesses, Second Statement - 3 guesses, Third Statement - 1 guess. This scoring rule is in place to reward players for statements that are neither obviously true nor clearly false.

The rounds get repeated until the all players who provided statements get to present their statements and the others to guess them. At the end of the game, the final scoring is displayed and the admin shall delete the room & statements.

Have fun while getting to know your fellow players better!
